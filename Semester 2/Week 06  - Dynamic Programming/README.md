### Fixed answer is the base of a recursion.

<ins>**Memoization**</ins>: A technique to optimize recursive algorithms by storing intermediate results. DP memoization uses recursion technique. This technique also known as top-down approach.  

<ins>**Tabulation**</ins>: DP tabulation uses iterative technique. This technique also known as bottom-up approach.  

## Which DP technique to use and why? 
> The memoization technique uses recursion which takes up internal stack memory fragement or call stack. But unlike stack memory halted during the process of memoization technique, the tabulation approach works directly without assistance of any external memory. There may be chances (although limited) memory to be overflowed in recursive DP or memoization. So, it is recommended use tabulation or bottom-approach.
