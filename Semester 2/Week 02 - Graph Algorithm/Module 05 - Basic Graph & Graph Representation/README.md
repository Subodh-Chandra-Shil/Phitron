> # **```Graph```**

Graph is a non-linear data structure which contains set of nodes may or may not connected with other nodes. 

**Non-linear** simply means, <ins>one to many connection</ins> and on the other hand, **linear** means <ins>one to one connection</ins>.

Nodes are said to be vertex (that holds various data) and the connection or relation between any two node is said to be an edge. 

We represent it as, **G(V, E)**

Depending upon direction of edges, graph could be classified into two types: 
1. **Directed graph**: Both nodes are poninting to each other. 
2. **Undirected graph**: Here a specific node pointng to the other node.
