## Python range function 
Generates a series of number in a range. 
```python
# generate numbers from 0 to 11 (12 is exclusive)
range(12) 

# generates number from 1 to 12
range(1, 13)

# 
range(2, 33, 2)
```

## Python f-string
F-string is a feature that let us use the mechanism called "String Literals", in which we can use variable in string and easily manipulate those variables inside the string. 

## Python input
The default input type in python is string. So, it assumes your input wil be string if you doesn't mention it explicitly.

## Increment and decrement operators
Python don't cover the traditional increment (++) decrement (--) operator.
Instead it only follows the basic way to increment and decrement.
```python
cnt = 0
cnt += 1
cnt -= 1
```
