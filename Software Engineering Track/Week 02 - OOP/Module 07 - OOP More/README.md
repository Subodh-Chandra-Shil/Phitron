## Overload
Overload is to use multiple methods with the same name, but different parameter signatures within the same class.

## Override
Overriding is to use a class method in a different way by changing is actual definition or implementation

## Static and class method 
Both static and class methods are allowed to be invoked without creating any specific class object or instance.

However, class method can have access to variables that declared within the class. But class method can't invoke or call any regular class method, until the method is classmethod or static method itself. Where on the other side, static method can't access or invoke anything from a class where it declared.
