> # ```String```
1. String is a sequence of characters 
2. Python strings are immuteable

> # ```Sequence```
A sequence is a consecutive data structure. 

## Tuple 
    1. Tuple combines in a parentheses.
    2. Once tuple is declared, it's items can't be reassigned or modified, since tuple items are immuteable.
    3. Tuple uses `()` brackets

## List
    1. List uses `[]` bracket
    2. List enmerate is a library function that let you check the index of a list item 

## Set
    1. Collection of unique elements
    2. Set uses `{}`

## Dictionary 
    1. Dictionary is a key-value pair, in other programming this data structure also known as dictionary, object, or hash table.
    2. Dictionary also uses {} bracket

| **1.** List is a data structure similar to an array.                                                      | **1.** Dictionary is a data structure that stores key-value pairs similar to C++ maps.                                 |
| **2.** It is a consecutive data structure, which means we can access the value of a list using its index. | **2.** Dictionaries also have an index known as a key. The key can be any data, and it could have corresponding value. |
| **3.** Lists can store duplicate values.                                                                  | **3.** Dictionaries cannot have duplicate key values.                                                                  |
