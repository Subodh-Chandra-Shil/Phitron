> # **```STL Vector```**

- The vector is a dynamic container class array, with the convention of runtime size modification. A vector increases it size by implementing a simple mechanism. Vector usually looks out what is the current size and if the size yet to surpass, then it will create another array by double down it's previous size. Now since, the size increases so it will shift all older element along with the newer value.
