**Header file**: Contains a lot of reuseable chunk of code. We usually import or use these code by declaring those header in C or C++ file. Header files often also said to be built in library of C or C++ programming language.

**main() function**: The main() function of C or C++ is a mandatory function, where compiler start reading or executing.

**function block**: Function wraps various statements and other declarations inside it's body. It usually wraps those code inside the function curly braces.

```
int main()
{
    /// your codes here
}
```

Since C or C++ uses bracket based approach to combine it's codes, thus it usually said to be 'curly bracket language'.
