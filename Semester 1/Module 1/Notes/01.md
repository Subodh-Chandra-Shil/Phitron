# ```Module 01```

**Header file**: Contains a lot of reuseable chunk of code. We usually import or use these code by declaring those header in C or C++ file. Header files often also said to be built in library of C or C++ programming language.

**main() function**: The main() function of C or C++ is a mandatory function, where compiler start reading or executing.

**function block**: Function wraps various statements and other declarations inside it's body. It usually wraps those code inside the function curly braces.

```
int main()
{
    /// your codes here
}
```

Since C or C++ uses bracket based approach to combine it's codes, thus it usually said to be 'curly bracket language'.

**Use of semicolon (;)**: Semicolon indicate ending of a line.

**built in function**: Functions that are packed up with the programming language. Programmer can use those built in by importing it's header. It means, built in functions are reside in header files as various functions. For example:

```
/// stdio.h is header file required to use printf() function
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    /// printf() function shows output in the console or terminal
    printf("Hello World");
}
```

**.h** is the extension for header file.

**Function**

return_type function_name(data_type param1, data_type param2)
{

    /// works will be done here

    return (return_type);
}
```
