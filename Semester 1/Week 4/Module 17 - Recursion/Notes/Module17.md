<h1 align="center"><b>Call Stack</b></h1>

The call stack is an internal data structure that stores information about active function calls and keeps track of their order. The first function that is invoked will be executed last in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) manner. Once a function is invoked, no other function below it in the call stack will execute until the invoked function returns.
